                    Abu Fehr Mahmoud Muhammad Shaker (Alexandria, 1 Feb 1909 â€“ Cairo, 7 Aug 1997) may Allah have mercy on him, is considered the Sheikh and leader of Arabic and the most prominent person who stood up to defend it in the fourteenth century AH (20th century AD) and defended the Islamic nation in the face of the massive waves of Westernization that have affected it over two hundred years.

                    He took in the entire Muslim heritage with careful reading and great studying, and he wrote lots of books and investigated lots and lots of other books for publishing. He chanted miraculous pieces of solid poetry, and his most famous poem was his great poem: "The Virgin Bow (Al-Qaws Al-Azraa)", in which he explained twenty-three poetry lines of a veteran Arab poet called Shammakh bin Dirar describing a poor bowman who made a bow with his hands and sold it and cried over it, he has explained it in three hundred verses which are among the sweetest and most eloquent poetry, he said: There is no line in those three hundred lines of poetry which was not directly extracted from the rhetoric of the twenty-three lines of Shammakh!
